# Elevate-ED 📚
**Elevate-ED** is a comprehensive 
educational management system designed to 
streamline administrative tasks and organize 
the learning environment efficiently.

## 🌟 About the Project
This is my first project on GitHub! **Elevate-ED** 
aims to provide a digital solution for managing 
the core pillars of any educational institution. 
Whether it's tracking attendance or managing 
course loads, this system centralizes 
everything in one place.

## 🛠️ Key Features
* **Schools:** Create and organize multiple school profiles.
* **Classrooms:** Organize physical or virtual learning spaces.
* **Teachers:** Manage faculty data, specialties, and assignments.
* **Students:** Maintain detailed records of student enrollment and progress.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To make it easy to run **Elevate-ED** on any 
operating system, I have provided setup scripts
located in the `/Run` directory. These scripts will
help you prepare the environment and launch
the application with a single command.

### How to Run
1. **Clone the repository:**
	```terminal
	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/kararkm61/Elevate-ED.git
	cd Elevate-ED
	```
2. **Execute the script for your OS:**
	Navigate to the Run folder and 
	run the appropriate file:
	* **Linux**: use Linux.sh
	```bash
	bash Data/Run/Linux.sh
	```
	* **MacOS** (Darwin): use Darwin.zsh
	```zsh
	zsh Data/Run/Darwin.zsh
	```
	* **Windows** (win32): use Win32.cmd
	```cmd
	Data/Run/Win32.cmd
	```
	Note: These scripts will automatically 
	check for Python and handle 
	the initial setup for you.
